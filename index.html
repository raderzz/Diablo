     <h3><p style="color: white;"> In the beginning, there was only one being in existence, a human looking figure named Anu. Upon introspection, he wanted to rid himself of all impurities and evils, so he physically cast them out from his body. They eventually coalesced together into the first Prime Evil, a 7-headed dragon called Tathamet. Anu and Tathamet fought until eventually they both destroyed each other. Anu’s spine became the Crystal Arch, around which the High Heavens formed and all angels were born. His eye became a powerful magical artifact called the Worldstone. Tathamet’s body became the burning fires of hell, and his 7 heads became the Great Evils(3 Prime Evils and 4 Lesser Evils).</p></h3>

   <h3><p style="color: white;"> angels and demons picked up where Anu and Tathamet left off: fighting forever in “The Great War” for control of the universe, with neither side ever gaining any real advantage. Eventually an angel named Inarius grew tired of the endless fighting, so he stole the Worldstone and absconded with the like-minded Lilith, daughter of Mephisto(Lord of Hatred), to create a world free of fighting, which they called Sanctuary. Other angels and demons weary of fighting sought refuge there, and they began mating and giving birth to nephalem/humans.</h3></p>

 <h3><p style="color: white;">nephalem had the ability to be more powerful than both angels and demons. Inarius felt threatened and wanted to kill them all, but Lilith wanted to use them to destroy heaven and hell to end The Great War. Inarius banished Lilith to a mysterious prison called The Void, and he tuned the Worldstone in a way that suppressed the nephalems’ powers. The Prime Evils discovered Sanctuary and tried to influence the humans to favor their cause. Angels discovered Sanctuary and viewed it as an abomination that had to be destroyed. Fighting between angels, demons, and nephalem on Sanctuary ensued. A super powerful nephalem named Uldyssian fought Inarius directly and imprisoned him. The angels and demons then made an agreement that they wouldn’t interfere with humans anymore, and the angels let Mephisto take the imprisoned Inarius to hell for punishment. </h3></p>

 <h3><p style="color: white;">The Lesser Evils got tired of the Prime Evils obsession with humans, so they led a revolt and banished them to Sanctuary. The Prime Evils began spreading evil among the humans, so the angel Tyreal decided he should do something to help. He formed a group of magi called the Horadrim who would imprison all 3 Prime Evils within soul stones. They trapped Mephisto and gave his soul stone to some priests called the Zakarum, but it corrupted them and they eventually broke his stone to set him free. Baal’s soul stone splintered while trying to entrap him, so it became too weak to hold him. The mage Tal Rasha agreed to use his body as an extension of the soul stone, so they caught Baal inside the stone, then stuck it into Tal Tasha’s chest and sealed him away within a tomb in the desert. Diablo was eventually captured too, and his soul stone was buried and a cathedral built on top of the burial site. Many years passed and the Horadrim were forgotten about, along with the soul stones.</h3></p>
